          <h2>SELF Fellowship</h2>
          <p>
            The SELF fellowship is a highly selective engineering fellowship at
            the University of Kansas. Through this program, I have been able to
            expand and refine my leadership, managerial, business,
            interpersonal, entrepreneurial, communication and engineering skills
            through mentoring, coursework, seminars and leadership
            opportunities.

            I founded the Suicide Awareness and Prevention club at the
            University of Kansas my freshman year. Since that time, I have
            served as the club's president. The club hosts speaker events on
            campus which aim to educate the student body on warning signs of
            suicide. This role has allowed me to apply my leadership and
            managerial skills to make a difference in my community.

          <h2>Vann Fellowship of Economics</h2>
          <p>
            The Vann Fellowship in Economics is a one year fellowship at the
            University of Kansas where members learn and apply critical economic
            concepts. This is done through coursework, lectures, and seminars
            from industry experts. I was selected to join this fellowship my
            sophomore year, and it allowed me to learn business skills which I
            would not have been exposed to through engineering curriculum.

          <h2>Startup School</h2>
          <p>
            The Startup School at the University of Kansas was offered starting
            in 2020, and I signed up immediately. This course took place over
            several months, and it gave students interested in technology
            startups an inside look at starting, funding, growing, and operating
            a successful startup. I have always been extremely interested in
            being involved in a startup, so this opportunity was a great way to
            be introduced to this culture.

          <h2>Sigma Phi Epsilon</h2>
          <p>
            Sigma Phi Epsilon is a fraternity at the University of Kansas which
            I have been a member of since my freshman year. This organization
            has provided me with opportunities to volunteer and improve my
            interpersonal skills.
