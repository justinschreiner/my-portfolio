          <p>
            I am rising senior at the University of Kansas studying Computer
            Science. During my time in KU, I have interned at Young Innovations,
            Inc, and Brand New Box.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have spent time developing my business and professional skills by
            being involved in the SELF and Vann fellowships on campus. I am very
            involved in Student Organizations, being the founder and president
            of KU's Suicide Awareness and Prevention club. I am also involved in
            KU's Entrepreneurship Club and Sigma Phi Epsilon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of school and programming, I spend most of my time listening
            to music, attending concerts and music festivals all over the
            country, and exercising. I also enjoy travelling, and I was
            fortunate to have the oportunity to spend my fall semester of my
            Junior year studying abroad in Sydney, Australia at Macquarie
            University.

            I develop distributed, multi-tiered web applications using Ruby on
